# BlackJack
My first Java project, the card game Black Jack. 

# Prerequisites
1. JDK 8 or later
 
# How to use
`$ gradlew run` 

# TODOs
* Proper File Structure, categorization of files
* Clean up MainApplication.java to make whole game flow code much more readable
* Renaming variables and methods in code to be clearer (some are quite sloppy)
